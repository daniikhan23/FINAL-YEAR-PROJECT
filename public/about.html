                <h4>A little hello from the creator</h4>
                <p>
                    Hello there! I'm Daniyal, a passionate third-year Computer Science 
                    student at Royal Holloway University of London. CheckersMate is my 
                    brainchild, born from my final year project themed 'Playing Games and 
                    Solving Puzzles Using AI'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the moment I was assigned this project, I knew I wanted to create 
                    something special. Combining my fascination with AI and a growing interest 
                    in web development, I embarked on this journey to bring you CheckersMate. 
                    It's more than just a game; it's a fusion of technology, strategy, and fun!
                </p>
                <h4>Why Checkers?</h4> 
                <p>
                    This project was an exciting opportunity to dive deep into the world of AI 
                    algorithms, particularly those used in strategic games like checkers and 
                    chess. The heart of our AI opponent in CheckersMate is the Minimax algorithm. 
                    Though currently straightforward and without alpha-beta pruning, it's a 
                    work in progress. I'm dedicated to evolving and enhancing it to make your 
                    AI adversary even more challenging.
                </p>
                <h4>The Joy of Web Development:</h4>
                <p>
                    Building CheckersMate has been a thrilling ride in web development. It's a 
                    field that I've grown to love, and I'm excited to keep adding new features 
                    and improvements to this site. Stay tuned for some exciting updates!
                </p>
                <h4>Looking Ahead:</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm captivated by game theory and the algorithms that teach computers to 
                    play strategic games. It's a fascinating world where logic, creativity, 
                    and technology intersect. Through CheckersMate, I hope to share this 
                    passion with you and provide a platform where fun and intellect go hand 
                    in hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for joining me on this adventure. Your support and feedback are 
                    what fuel my journey in making CheckersMate a haven for strategy game 
                    lovers everywhere. Let's play, learn, and grow together!
