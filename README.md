# Final Year Project

Hi and welcome to CheckersMate!

If you're interested in checking the website out, its running live on GitHub pages at: https://daniikhan23.github.io/FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT/public/html/index.html

Otherwise you can clone the repository, go into public/html and open up index.html in a browser of you choice. There you will find options to visit any of the pages available
as well as play a local multiplayer or against an AI opponent on the "Game" page. There's no installation of any kind involved. 
If you use VSCode and have the extension "Live Server" just open up the index.html page in public/html and click "Go Live" on the bottom right hand corner and it will automatically open up the page for you.

Here's a link to the documentation: https://daniikhan23.github.io/FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT/docs/modules.html

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.
