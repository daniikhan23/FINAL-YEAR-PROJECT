Week 1:
Research generally on AI and Constraint Satisfaction

Week 2:
Research on Idea of the project
Start of Project Plan
Start of Abstract writing general AI definitions, algorithms and learning types

Week 3:
Decided project idea to be based on Checkers
More research on Constraint Satisfaction and some of its techniques
Research on algorithms that would be involed in implementation:
    Minimax
    Alpha-beta pruning
    Heuristic Evaluation
Research on Checkers and its rules
Finalised Project Plan and decided timelines of development

Week 4:
Added boilerplate HTML/CSS/JS code

Week 5:
Implementing a checkers board using an array in javascript
Adding relevant HTMl and CSS as well as using DOM Manipulation to correctly
display the board

Week 6:
Researched and learned TypeScript to have a more object oriented approach 
to the development of the game.
Simply using an array to store the state of the board and continue development
is doable but will lead to complications down the line.

Restructured file system and converted existing JS code to TypeScript
